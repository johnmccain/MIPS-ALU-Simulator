rsh arithmetic (keep the -1) vs logical (pad with 0s)
don't need to worry about that with lsh
(in Minden's gcc, signed ints do arithmetic, unsigned do logical)

look at Minden's emails concerning stuff you don't need to implement (high/low registers)

Rd

Rt

Rs

^what are those

"immediate value is 16 bit 2s complement value which means ff80 in instruction
now you are taking that 16 bit 2s complement number and you are adding to a 32 bit 2s complement number
and to do that you need to extend the sign of the 16 bit number to the 32 bits
how to take 16 bit 2s complement number and sign extend it?

(int32_t)(int16_t) ImmediateValue //this does a sign extension

also I listen to coldplay"
